My favourite dish is **Red Sauce Pasta**


*Pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine but is equally loved in India too. It is available in a variety of shapes and sizes and tastes best when cooked with sauce. Each sauce is unique in flavour and it enhances the flavour of the pasta and other ingredients added in it.*

**Red Sauce Pasta**
*Red sauce is made up of tomatoes, garlic, red chilli peppers and olive oil. A blend of these ingredients gives it the perfect spicy flavour.Tomatoes not only provide taste but are also a rich source of lycopene and vitamin C. Lycopene helps combat free radicals and protects our immune system whereas vitamin C is a potent antioxidant which helps fight against diseases. Along with the added health benefits, red sauce is not very high in calories as it consists mainly of tomatoes and vegetables. One serving (150g) of pasta in arrabbiata sauce is about 210 calories.*
